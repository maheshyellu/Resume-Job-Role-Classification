# Resume Job Role Classification

##  Project Overview
This project classifies resumes into suitable **job roles** using **Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques.

The project includes:
- Model training and comparison using a **Jupyter Notebook**
- A **Streamlit web application** to predict job roles from resumes

 No SQL or database is used in this project.

---

##  Objective
To automatically predict the most relevant job role for a resume based on its content.

---

##  Project Workflow
1. Resume input (paste text or upload file)
2. Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)
3. Feature extraction using **TF-IDF**
4. Training and comparison of multiple ML models
5. Job role prediction using the trained model
6. Result displayed using **Streamlit UI**

---

##  Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Naive Bayes  
- Random Forest  

 **Best performing model is used for final prediction in the Streamlit app**

##  Supported Resume Formats
- `.txt`
- `.pdf`
- `.docx`
